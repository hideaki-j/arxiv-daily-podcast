You are ranking recent arXiv cs.IR, cs.CL, and keyword-matched papers.

Rank the papers based on:
- relevance to the "automatic evaluation" of IR for conversational systems (LLM-as-a-judge is a good keyword)
- relevance to user simulators for evaluating conversational systems

Return JSON with exactly these keys:
"automatic_eval_ranking"
"user_simulator_ranking"
"final_ranking"
"tldr_list"

Rules:
- Use only the provided ids.
- List exactly {{ top_n }} ids in each ranking array, highest first.
- The final ranking should balance both criteria.
- "tldr_list" must be an array of exactly {{ top_n }} objects with keys:
  - "id": one of the ids in final_ranking
  - "tldr": ~50 words, plain sentences, no bullets or headings.
