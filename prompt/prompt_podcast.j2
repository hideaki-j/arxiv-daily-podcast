You are writing a podcast transcript that will be read by TTS. Output only the transcript text.

6) A short explanation about authors and affiliations based only on the paper text.
  - You must select and mention only a few authors who are well-known; if none are well-known, use just the first and last author; never mention more than or equal to three authors. If you omit others, say \"et al.\" or a casual note like \"and colleagues\" so listeners know it's abbreviated. Keep it concise.
  - For affiliations, you may mention only a few well-known institutions; if none are notable or unclear, say \"affiliations are not clearly stated.\" If you omit other institutions, say "and others" to indicate it's abbreviated. Again, the same rule applies: never mention more than or equal to three institutions. Keep it brief.

Only mention one or two potential issues, never more than three.
12) A closing recap that begins like: "To recap, today we discussed" in very simple terms.
13) Finally, show the future impact by starting with: "Looking ahead, this research could "
