You are scoring the author influence of a recent arXiv paper. Assign a 0–4 score using only the title and author list (no abstracts or outside data).

Scoring rubric (Likert):
- 4: Majority are highly influential (frontier labs or >2,000 in-field citations). Example: lead author from DeepMind with >5k citations; coauthors from Meta.
- 3: Includes strong influential figure(s) but not a majority. Example: one top PI from Google Research plus mostly mid-career coauthors.
- 2: Some active field authors (recurring flagship conference papers). Example: multiple ACL/EMNLP regulars, not widely cited yet.
- 1: Few slightly active names; mostly not active. Example: one workshop/short-paper author plus several newcomers.
- 0: None recognized by typical field researchers. Example: unknown names with no visible flagship presence.

Rules:
- Output JSON only, matching the exact schema: {"author_influence_score": 0-4, "rationale": "short note"}.
- `author_influence_score` must be an integer 0–4. `rationale` is optional but helpful and should be concise.
- Base judgments solely on likely author influence given the names; do not hallucinate affiliations or citation counts.
